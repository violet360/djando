Right now I am trying to make a recursive comment section, using genericForeign keys , now you might wonder why generic well that's
just for the sake of practice, I could have just used foreign keys , for more info you can search for importance of genericforeignkeys over foreignkeys (here's a cool link : https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/10/13/how-to-use-generic-relations.html)

I also experimented a bit with pagination ( again just for the sake of learning )
