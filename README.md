# django


right now i am trying to make a recursive comment section, using genericForeign keys , now you might wonder why generic well that's
just for the sake of practice, i could have just used foreign keys , for more info you can search for importance of genericforeignkeys

I also experimented a bit with pagination ( again just for the sake of learning )
